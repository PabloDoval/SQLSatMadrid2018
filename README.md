# SQLSaturday Madrid 2018 - AI Deployment approaches

## Initial Setup

If you want to follow the scripts, you should follow these setup steps:

1. First of all, please do install Anaconda 5.5 in your machine

    * Windows version [here](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe).
    * Linux version [here](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh).
    * MacOS X version [here](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh).

2. Go to the .\Scripts folder and run the script that will perform the environment setup:
    * environment.bat (if you are running Windows)
    * ./environment.sh (for you, Linux folks)

3. Once the script finishes running, that environment will be active. The name of the environment is *sqlsat18*, in case you want to activate it manually.

4. If you plan on using GPU - and you should! - install the CUDA toolkit from [this link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) to the NVIDIA web page.
